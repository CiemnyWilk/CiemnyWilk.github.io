                    <P>
                        I have looked at both the Destiny 2 Subbredit and Destiny the game subreddit to compare them and
                        see their different uses and if they should still be separated or combined. I selected this
                        topic because I have always been a Destiny player and wondered if it would be easier to combine
                        both subreddits to make it easier for people to look through them. After collecting this data it
                        shows that they both have very specific use cases and that it is important for them to remain
                        apart and then be together. Now I have two different versions of the data that I collected. I
                        have the all-time most upvoted posts and the top-of-the-month posts for the time I collected the
                        said data. This is to compare their current uses vs what they may have been used in the past. I
                        collected this data by manually scraping the data from the <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/" target="_blank">Destiny 2
                            subreddit</a> and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/" target="_blank">the
                            Game subbredit</a>.

                        What is Destiny?

                    <p>
                        Destiny is a first-person shooter that incorporates Role-Playing and MMO elements that were
                        published by the original Halo creator, Bungie. Destiny 2 was initially released on September 6,
                        2017.

                        Since Destiny 2 is a live service-based game it has gone through many highs and lows in its
                        reception over these years but has been able to keep a fairly consistent player base since it
                        was
                        added to Steam.
