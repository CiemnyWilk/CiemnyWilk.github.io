                <p>
                    The Allegry of Superposition was a group project that I worked on in my second semester of GIMM.
                    This game was part of an assignment where we were tasked with turning an abstract idea
                    (Superposition) and to use different Media to try and explain said topic. My group and I chose to go
                    down the Game route and created a game that was a mix of a platformer and a puzzle game. The game
                    was created in Unity and was a 2D game. The game was created over the course of 2 months and was a
                    fun project to work on. The game was created by a team of 3 people and I was the lead programmer and
                    Scrum Master for the project. We chose to make a short story about a 4th dimensional being that was
                    trying to study his ancestors but then suddenly a person shows up and throws all of his books on his
                    people into the 3D world so our character must jump in to the 3D world to gain his knowledge back.
                    As you play you are trying to collect all his books that have happened to land in this lab and every
                    time you collect a book you gain a new ability. You at first gain the ability to change what
                    timeline you are in, so you can either be in the present or the past and must use that ability to
                    make your way to the next book. Your second ability is the ability to change the state of objects,
                    and your final ability is the ability to change the state of yourself.
