                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I am Austin Yarnot, a passionate game design major currently a full-time student for GIMM
                    (Games, Interactive, Media, Mobile Technology) at Bosie State University. I am currently in my
                    second year of classes doing my best to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love for game design has delved into multiple different aspects but I have a particular focus on
                    level design and programming. Through my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming, 2D
                    and 3D art, level design, and UI/UX design, and have even dabbled in website development. During my
                    time I have also honed skills as a “Scrum master” for multiple projects. These skills have allowed
                    me to broaden my understanding of the ins and outs of game development and also helped me be even
                    more creative with my ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the classroom, I find joy in going on longboard rides with friends, and even in my
                    leisurely moments have taken up the challenge of learning the piano.
